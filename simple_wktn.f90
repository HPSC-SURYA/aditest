! the problem with the wakatani method is that it is very abstracted from our problem
! you have to take adi, isolate the tridi solve, then isolate a single recursion relation
! (of which there are two), then apply this algorithm

! the purpose of this code is to just code up the recursion relation
! then we can build on this and have something that is useful to us
